## Tech Stack

HTML, CSS, JavaScript



## The Takeaway

This project taught me the importance of not getting too attached to my code. There were a few moments when I realized I was on the wrong track and I had to learn to be okay with starting over from scratch. I spent a good amount of time fine-tuning the CSS to get it just right, which was an excellent opportunity to sharpen my styling skills. 

One key lesson I learned was regarding how I handled dynamically added elements. Specifically, I was attaching event listeners directly to dynamically added elements, which proved inefficient. By switching to event delegation, I could handle events more effectively and manage dynamic content better.

Overall, it was a challenging but rewarding project that made me feel much more comfortable using the skills I've been learning so far, and it was satisfying to see them all connect on one website.
